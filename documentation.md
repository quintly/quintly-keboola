#Prerequisites
To get started with this integration you need have a quintly subscription and access to your API credentials (client id and secret). For more details about the quintly packages see https://www.quintly.com and for requesting API access please reach out to support@quintly.com

#Notes
* To select the right profiles for your request please enter the quintly profile ids into the "Profile Ids" field. If you want to specify multiple profiles at once, just enter them comma-separated without any spaces.
* After you have run your first job, we recommend to set the primary keys on the resulting tables. This will make sure that the data is updated correctly in the future in case you use "incremental updates".
